## Motivation

Coming closer to graduation, I was looking for a better way to showcase my resume and progression as a computer science student and web developer, to allow for new opportunities and collaborations. 

## Challenges

Adapting my portfolio for GAE hosting had been a challenge. Between learning how to force HTTPS through the use of Express and Helmet frameworks for Node, to adapting and optimizing deployment, this had definetley made for a fun project -- while remaining free (for the most part) thanks to Google Cloud.
